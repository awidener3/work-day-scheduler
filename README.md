# work-day-scheduler
This project is a homework assignment from the UCF Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I am tasked with creating a daily work scheduler that allows the user to input tasks for each work day hour, which is then saved to the localStorage database. The application will be created with jQuery, and dynamic dates and times will use the moment.js API.
